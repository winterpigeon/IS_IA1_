Digital signatures authenticate the sender of a digital
message or document and ensure its integrity, 
confirming that it hasn't been altered in transit.
They achieve the security goal of non-repudiation, 
meaning the sender cannot deny sending the message, 
providing a reliable method for verifying the origin 
and authenticity of electronic communications.
